							AIA Pensions        
							
	
		   
	
	
		Approximately 5% of people live comfortably after retirement. Most of us do not fall into that category because we fail to plan. Now AIA provides you the opportunity to be within that 5% by introducing a pension for everyone in Sri Lanka. All you are required to do is to decide when to retire, how much you will need as a monthly pension and for how long you will need that pension.
	
        
	A monthly pension for you

You will start receiving a monthly pension commencing from your chosen Retirement Age. You have the option of choosing a pension receiving period between 10 - 30 years. Even if you are unable to pay your premium (during the premium paying term) due to a Total Permanent Disability, the Company will pay the premium on your behalf ensuring continuous build-up of your Pension fund, assuring you a monthly pension from the Retirement Age.

A pension for your spouse, if you are not there

In the unforeseen event of your death AIA will continue your policy by paying the premium on your behalf, ensuring that your spouse or dependents receive a monthly pension until the end of the opted pension receiving period.

Investment choices to build your fund

You have a choice of four investment strategies, namely Cautious, Moderate, Aggressive and Advanced which allow you to invest your Pension Fund in investment options ranging from Treasury Bills to the Stock Market.

A safeguard against inflation

An in-built inflation guard protects your Pension Fund against inflation even in the unforeseen event of your death or Total Permanent Disability.

A Life Cover that suits you 

AIA Pensions offers you a life cover that is twice your initial annual basic premium. In addition by paying a nominal amount you have the option of increasing your life cover if required.

Ability to withdraw funds in an emergency

After the completion of three policy years, you have the option to withdraw up to 15% of the Pension Fund as an emergency withdrawal, once during the premium paying term. In addition to the emergency withdrawal, upon reaching the retirement age you will have the option of making a withdrawal of up to 100% of your Pension Fund.
 


If you make a withdrawal of 100% of your Pension Fund, your policy will cease and you will not receive a monthly pension. However, if you withdraw only a part of your Pension fund, your monthly Pension will depend on the balance of your Pension Fund and the opted Pension receiving period.
